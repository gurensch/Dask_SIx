This repository shows the Python scripts that are employed to get the phenology and false spring data for the MSc thesis 'Exploring vegetation seasonality at large scale and determining its uncertainty. A case study with ensemble weather data and the extended spring indices". The data that is used in this study is the [E-OBS full ensemble dataset](https://www.ecad.eu/download/ensembles/download.php), which can be acquired on request.
